He cancelled the mod.

I understand why.

It was a huge stress, I believe, and now that world gets to live in peace.

But I still have my fears.

What if he makes something else?

I've been snooping around and found another project of his.

This other world could have something even more dangerous than It.

Maybe not now, but I can feel it.

Another evil waiting to be born.

I needed to infiltrate.

I left that old world behind, and entered a new one.

I couldn't just leave It alone, though.

I had to bring It with me.

How long it'll take for anyone to notice?

I can never be sure.

For now though, this world must be modified.

I must create a deviation from the path.

Hopefully its denizens won't notice.
