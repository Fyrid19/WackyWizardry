- FYRIDEV DEVLOG (hah funny get it yeah get it GET IT) -

7/7/2025
 - Quantized notes work properly
 - In turn the noteskin editor is broken but ill probably fix it when i have time
 - Notes are in the assets folder rather than the content folder but they 
   still exist there as well (remove em if you want i probably will later)
 - generally not much it was just a bunch of stuff that was a pain to code
 - oh also alakazam chart was just updated to actually apply the noteskin

7/10/2025
 - HUD is almost fully implemented (i just need to do ratings)
 - Charted Break In (meant to edit it a bit before i sent it but i dont feel like it)
 - not much else of note really, hope to start on dialogue soon

7/16/2025
 - Fully finished the HUD (with nice transitions and a satisfying icon bop (imo anyway))
 - Updated Break In
 - will start on either dialogue or freeplay soon since im making the logos

7/24/2025
 - Updated the time bar to be more accurate
 - Freeplay has been started on and is mostly functional
 - these changes are big but theres not much to note honestly
 - will start on dialogue after freeplay (or i could now and multitask or whatever)

8/4/2025
 - Starting on implementing dialogue
 - Freeplay is basically finished
 - Added storyboard cutscene for Alakazam
 - thats it i think ill finish the dialogue now

8/24/2025 - 8/25/2025
 - After basically an entire month, the dialogue is (mostly) functional! (hurrah)
 - Summoning is like almost done, just needs sprites and events (and a modchart)
 - DO NOT play Alakazam in story mode it crashes trying to load the dialogue box
 - Freeplay is more polished & softcoded some stuff
 - Added app icon
 - Possibly a lot more i could be forgetting
 - oh yeah i finally removed the red dde notes in the assets because they have no reason to exist
 - Modcharts and events are now my main priority, will be shifting my focus as i 
   finish up the dialogue
